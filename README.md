# DemoApp
We will be creating a free student registration to a course or a program we are offering. Here are the lists of the courses we are offering: `HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, React, Angular, C#, Pyton, C++, MongoDB, MySQL, SharePoint Framework (SPFX)`. And the list of programs we are offering: `Web Design, Web back-end development with Node, Full Stack Web Development, RDBMS, Non-Relational Database Development`. Therefore, the application should have `login, sign up and main pages` to capture the user information and be able to login and register for courses and programs. As this application requires authentication and authorization, we will be using MySQL RDMS and the passport module.
